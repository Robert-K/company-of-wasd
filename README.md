# Company of WASD


### AutoHotkey is not required to run the executable!

## How does it work?
While the game is in focus, CoWASD will remap the WASD keys to the arrow keys. Q and E will rotate the camera while pressed.

As the game originally mapped some actions to WASDQE, CoWASD also remaps the following keys:
- r => e
- t => r
- g => a
- b => s
- n => d
- m => w
